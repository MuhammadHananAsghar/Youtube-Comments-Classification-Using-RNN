1157,Positive,think one of the hardest things to do is to learn without having deadlines and all that kind of stuff mean when you are done with school or maybe even university must feel like being truly free of all your duties and can only imagine that thats where lot of people really fall in kind of hole in their life witch basically already sets you up for all your coming years until your or whatever and you retire while having life live worth nothing and lacking of everything but dept when we are done with our education life will put us in our place but its we who get to choose where it puts us but only when we overcome ourselves and stand the fuck up and get things done come on fellow humans sooner or later we will all die and no one will care unless we achieved great which we are all capable of doing it doesnt matter if you do it for humanity or all for yourself dont let your dreams die and start working on them if you want to learn something you can believe in your self and just like we have all heard it thousand times just do it nothing is impossible and make your dreams come true you dont need my motivation you are your own motivation

1219,Positive,few things shit me more than to hear speech going on about how it all comes down to simple choice that one can make and that this simple choice will change everything now this may be the case for some but not for others the reality for some people is that this is simply not true for some people all things are not equal they do not have equal opportunity to access or apply themselves into or to situations that matter to them for whole range of reasons people are excluded from areas of life they see going on around themand this is difficult to accept try being marginalised in society through no fault of your own and have someone tell you just make choice to change what you need is within you what if it is not within you what if the change is needed by the rest of the world and what if that change will never come and what if you have no one to support you or to even listen hear you

524,Neutral,need one of those outlet thingys
525,Neutral,dont try this at home instead try this on gas station
526,Neutral,didnt see the point with this as you can buy charger with output but uh yeah for content guess
527,Neutral,was the one who actually searched for this
528,Neutral,what happens if you plug iphone chargers in an iphone
529,Positive,lol hope you get enought money from this video to pay the electric bill
530,Positive,lol hope you get enought money from this video to pay the electric bill
531,Neutral,xiaomi has charger could you do with those too
532,Neutral,mom where are you going son me to get phone charger
533,Neutral,sooo this is were all my chargers went
534,Neutral,when being an unstoppable empire is not enough for palpatine
535,Negative,mean hate tech rax and how he wastes time explain everything really simple but this was pretty funny idea
536,Positive,the explanation the chemical ions within the cords that powers them powerful enough to carry the electricities all the way simple terms not enough power now why when using electrical currents for conduction we scientists know that the vapor that sends the currents into shock do that when we hit the power button
537,Neutral,me is this environmental care apple well yes but actually no
538,Negative,fake you fastforwarded see the time in minutes
539,Positive,buy samsung galaxy it has super faster charging and download the keepclean and noxcleaner it can boost your phone
540,Positive,it doesnt work like that the phone will consume only certain amount of charge amps it needs so theres no point in connecting it to charges charging speed may get slightly altered as the phone can now eat more amps
541,Positive,ok where on earth do you get that many chargers where do you get that big extension cord thing give apple there chargers back
542,Positive,apple no more chargers have too many at home techrex
543,Positive,are you kidding this experiment is real how is it possible
544,Positive,it gets more powered and faster
545,Positive,ps clearly you do not know how electricity works because your still going to have the same input and output from those chargers as if you were just plugging one charger in
546,Positive,watt chargers of cheap phones do the same as chargers
547,Neutral,was thinking it would charge in minute or so
548,Neutral,nobody that guy in math problems
549,Neutral,me looks at my iphone my phone dont even think about it
550,Neutral,him in what happens if you plug tesla chargers to tesla
551,Negative,this man is insane
552,Neutral,no one talking about how doing this at in the morning
553,Neutral,братан так можно хату сжечь
554,Neutral,apple give out chargers techrax yes us yes
555,Neutral,are you doing step chargers
556,Positive,imagine the phone just exploded lmao
557,Positive,nobody this guy try this at home it useful
558,Positive,next what happens if you plugged chargers in an iphone super charge
559,Neutral,so like which battery held the charge longer id like to see that test
560,Neutral,now got to know that why iphone is not coming with charger this guy took em all
561,Negative,why waste your time when only 𝑫𝑨𝑫𝒀𝑨𝑷𝑷𝑪𝑶𝑴 does it for everybody
562,Neutral,alternative title how to make bomb at home
563,Positive,wow that so goid bro
564,Positive,fun fact it only plug lol
565,Neutral,he has charges in one and on in the othe phone
566,Positive,laughing in xiaomi fast charge
567,Neutral,imagine what his electricity bill is
568,Negative,its fake at in first phone its on the second its
569,Negative,the people who disliked because the phone with chargers the battery reach
570,Neutral,that seems like fire hazard
571,Neutral,now power this up with the big ipad battery and make it chargers
572,Neutral,an insta post about this video posted days ago gained likes searched what happens and it autocompleted with this video wasnt alone trying to find this
573,Negative,expected an explosion
574,Neutral,my iphone charger faster
575,Neutral,imagine this mans electricity bill after this
576,Negative,anyone else wonder why the phones didnt go dark and turn off and also didnt see him touch this
577,Neutral,electricians freaking out rn
578,Neutral,just buy charging plug smh
579,Neutral,he will never go without charger
580,Positive,it didnt work because the first ones battery optimization was off
581,Neutral,so counted and did the math actually only chargers if counted correctly because chargers in row and rows close enough but
582,Neutral,mrbeasti charges an iphone with chargers
583,Neutral,im only watching the apple clock
584,Neutral,sim eu sou comentário br que tu procura
585,Positive,most phones today have current regulator built inside the phones to prevent it from overheating and catch fire this experiment is mute
586,Negative,if do this on samsung its gonna be less than minute
587,Neutral,iphone has over current protection over voltage protection charger leads are wired in parallel and does nothing to help this is the electrical equvilent to plugging ur tv into socketoutlets in you home
588,Neutral,kaboom yes rico kaboom
589,Negative,wonder how the physics behind that works
590,Neutral,came here after seeing this meme on insta anyone else
591,Positive,how much would sell single charger for
592,Positive,no wonder there out of stock and not even on new iphones boxes this guy took them all
593,Neutral,explosive device acquired
594,Neutral,maybe reason why apple decided to not include the chargers for the newer models
595,Neutral,electricity bill stonks
596,Negative,why waste your time when only 𝐃𝐀𝐃𝐘𝐀𝐏𝐏𝐂𝐎𝐌 does it for everybody
597,Positive,friend can borrow charger this guy witch one and how many
598,Neutral,would stick to dadya𝐏𝐏c𝐎m thats where we get ours
599,Neutral,charger am joke to you
600,Negative,sorry but chargers my ipad charger charges my phone up to percent in like minutes
601,Positive,if you so much iphones then send me
602,Positive,apple worker so how many chargers would you like him yes
603,Positive,lol bes some looser really needs grabage iphone charger too haha buy and android
604,Neutral,where the video starts
605,Neutral,volts equals volts into iphone
606,Neutral,what happens when you charge phone it gets charged
607,Neutral,electricity bill your entire life savings
608,Neutral,imagine this dudes electricity bill
609,Neutral,electroboom
610,Neutral,bruh he got miss calls from apple company
611,Neutral,who thought it was gonna go up like percent second
612,Neutral,see you guys in years when this gets recommended
613,Negative,the owner of the iphone does not know how the electricity works but nothing new now do experiments on how glasses of different colors break down
614,Negative,well it gives the phone insane luck to help it speedrun
615,Neutral,use tablet charging blocks make lot of difference
616,Neutral,anyone else got this video recommended at
617,Negative,apple chargers exist this guy ill take your entire stock
618,Positive,isnt better to had same wallpaper but thx for video
619,Neutral,stop wasting time guurusweb at ig do fix it permanently
620,Positive,do believe the battery can only take in so much power at time
621,Neutral,everyone watches to see what happens when you charge phone whit chargers me who has phones or three if you record with phone
622,Neutral,him plugs chargers in iphone million people
623,Neutral,times power adapter on iphone
624,Neutral,no we should try it charges faster because nothing happen was so scrd that it would explose but thankfully the opposite happened
625,Positive,my mans electric company gonna be rich
626,Negative,disappointed gave this my view
627,Neutral,apple we removed the charging brick to save the environment techrax
628,Neutral,meanwhile in our universe boom aaaaaa
629,Neutral,why does the cables look like the string handle on paper bag
630,Negative,too long didnt read it exploded
631,Positive,wow two hours to charge to almost
632,Neutral,friend you have charger my phones techrax no
633,Negative,expected it to blow up or sum
634,Positive,charger my mom when play games how are you not tired yet go and get some rest charger
635,Positive,bro try using the super fast charging cubes
636,Positive,not really worth it if you want to watch the whole video faster and fks up ur battery
637,Neutral,my and se charges in like mins
638,Positive,it only consumed certain account of volts for example if you plugged lamp in then the output is in the uk but it only gives out to the lamp
639,Neutral,momson why is the power sonummmmmmmmmmm idk
640,Neutral,anyone else here from the pinterest meme
641,Negative,this guy wastes money and effort for making charger contraption phone with maximum wattage charging limit no
642,Neutral,do thousand chargers
643,Neutral,yamete chargerkun
644,Positive,need to do this lmao
645,Neutral,actually searched for this
646,Neutral,this man stole all the chargers thats why we will have only phone in the box
647,Neutral,omggg
648,Neutral,господи него есть почка
649,Negative,is it just me or he supposed to be sleeping at am mean he be trying to blow up his house rn yes stay quite so you mom hear xd
650,Neutral,tried it my house blew up
651,Positive,girlfriend probably cheating on me right now him
652,Neutral,dont batteries have input limiters in em think this is cb
653,Neutral,joke is that he will use only one charger
654,Negative,this guy is the goat for doing this science project for some random kid who decides to do this in
655,Positive,knew this is what was gonna happen first of all it cant instantly be at the battery of any phone is built to only take in so much juice at time to try and avoid overcharge or damaging the battery secondly do wanna say that if you use any charger with the wrong watt too many times its gonna destroy your battery making it not hold charge anymore when this happens youll notice it charges faster but also dies much faster
656,Positive,he basically built fast charger and the phone utilizing all of the bricks because the iphone limits the charge
657,Neutral,assuming one charger puts out that means he is charging the phone with watts equal to tvs
658,Neutral,next title going to put chargers in an iphone
659,Neutral,remember the times we had
660,Neutral,the instant charge got me here
661,Positive,the dislikes are the people in his town who experienced blackout last week and only just found the source of it
662,Negative,huh wonder why the other one is going slower mabye it because all the dam power on his street is being used by the hundred chargers
663,Neutral,try using ipad cubes they work faster for iphones
664,Positive,chargers for couple minutes for it to be full let see how they deal with million chargers
665,Positive,but really cool is if water gets in my cars usb port my iphone will tell me to unplug my charger and let it dry
666,Neutral,friend me use your him
667,Neutral,looking at my charger and like damn
668,Positive,watt ultra charger only buy along with your own screenless iphone pro max for only your total would be along with taxes around
669,Neutral,your choice but only 𝑫𝑨𝑫𝒀𝑨𝑷𝑷𝑪𝑶𝑴
670,Neutral,is nobody gonna worry about how it was at at am
671,Positive,honey why is the electric bill more than the rent
672,Positive,kuya kung gusto mong mamatay wag ka mang damay ng iba okay wala ako sa mood mag english ikaw mag
673,Positive,hahahaha lolololololol so many chargers thats so ridiculous lol
674,Neutral,if the resistance of the phone doesnt change you could put chargers in parallel and the output will be the same
675,Neutral,bruuh samsung is still faster xd
676,Neutral,moral of the story just use an ipad charger for faster charging
677,Neutral,trillion chargers instant charge
678,Negative,why waste your time when only 𝑫𝑨𝑫𝒀𝑨𝑷𝑷𝑪𝑶𝑴 does it for everybody
679,Positive,lmao but the power be the same between the two all coming from the same power output of see how multiple of the same power output would produce more power no electrician so might be wrong
680,Negative,friend can borrow one of your chargers techrax sorry need all of them
681,Negative,the electricity bill is going to be expensive
682,Neutral,it fully change it only charges it five
683,Neutral,tried
684,Neutral,that one kid who is gamer and cant last second whitouth playing even at night at anytimeand am they play without their mom knowing
685,Neutral,the forgot to charge my phone last night and the school bus is outside charger
686,Neutral,guys this guy is the jaystation of iphone mutilation guys
687,Negative,whats sad is that my android charger charges my phone faster than all of the combined
688,Positive,can buy this charger lmao
689,Positive,now try to eat with hands hire some people vs tray to eat with hand show us which plan is better good luck
690,Neutral,this is definitely video going to be recommended to us in years
691,Neutral,no charger was harmed in this video
692,Positive,that could be why apple is not giving chargers in the new iphone
693,Neutral,can you give me one charger plz
694,Negative,the charger with the square phone is faster than the other charger
695,Neutral,me hey bro your outlets my phones dying friend outlets me yes
696,Neutral,seguitelo fa head head fra telefoni fatti bene in passato ha fatto head head tra smartphone di diversi marchi poi tra smartphone iphone ora ha iniziato con huawei
697,Neutral,phone only needs one charger to plug in
698,Negative,fake theres voltage limiter in the phones they will always charge at same speed so the phone does not explode
699,Neutral,his parents probably allow him to do this and why he records it on am in the morning
700,Negative,you are crazy you can create black hole by this way
701,Positive,lol expected instant charge
702,Positive,that phone you plug is gonna explode its not good too plug too many chargers
703,Neutral,have even one working charger and this man have hundreds of em
704,Positive,you will never know why got these many likes
705,Positive,yo guys get your usaukand canada credit cards from cashflukes on telegram bought one from him and it worked so happy finally got real cc plug thanks to him for being real
706,Neutral,plot twist photoshopped
707,Neutral,as an electrician all im gonna say is bruh
708,Positive,well used and frankly its real
709,Negative,what we learned theres literally no difference except one being waste of time
710,Neutral,when maybe minute already jk
711,Neutral,firehazards
712,Positive,lol my phone charges in with one charger
713,Neutral,chinese chargers
714,Positive,so it takes chargers to make iphone charge as fast as an adroid
715,Positive,wow that is one hell of fire hazard xd
716,Positive,be honest we came for the meme
717,Negative,apple where did all our chargers go this guy evil laugh
718,Positive,try parallel linear connection next time lol not parallel
719,Neutral,can you please give me chargers
720,Positive,expected huge difference hardly different
721,Negative,when you always say apple chargers are slow
722,Positive,ngl they are all wired in parallel so you would only get the same amount of voltage as charger but the amp rating would significantly increase believe most smart phones detect amperage and control it
723,Neutral,this is me when was
724,Neutral,apple we need money techrax need content deal
725,Positive,was imagining more of type result
726,Neutral,didnt go boom coincedens think not
727,Neutral,me only has charger my parents
728,Neutral,need sleep need
729,Positive,instead of doing this experiment wouldnt you ask this question to an electronics engineer popular culture
730,Neutral,everyone thats why they stopped selling the chagers with the phone me where the hell did he buy slot outlet and where can get one
731,Neutral,this should be named how to make
732,Positive,lets plug it in and whole house explodes
733,Neutral,expectation instant hundred reality per minute
734,Negative,mom what you gonna do with all those chargers guy its for complicated scientific research
735,Positive,apple hey guys trying to get the environment better by getting rid of the power adapter and cable this guy
736,Neutral,can sell this to meeeee
737,Neutral,pov here from the meme
738,Neutral,ngl thought it was gonna catch on fire
739,Neutral,później rodzice co ty zrobiles ze mam tyle do zaplacenia za prąd
740,Negative,didnt he only turn off optimized charging for the one phone also this is pointless the circuit boards of the chargers all have voltage regulators
741,Neutral,cant wait to see his electric bill
742,Neutral,imagine having vs not being humongous difference
743,Neutral,xdddddddddd
744,Neutral,kaboom
745,Neutral,he actually does something at
746,Negative,once you understand that current is demanded by the device rather than given by the charger you will then understand where those hours of wasted time went
747,Neutral,thought that it will explode
748,Negative,me and my broken charger
749,Negative,stupid only output of lighting port only amps max
750,Neutral,know your electricicity bill was like
751,Neutral,clickbate he put chagers
752,Positive,like to say this is clickbait kinda but not because more than chargers plugged in
753,Positive,outlet power strip costs grand
754,Positive,so you really think you would times the power how did you even think you could push that many amps through that little tiny connector lol too funny obviously you dont even have knowledge about this area
755,Neutral,oh there it is wonder how it got therei left in the car were did it go
756,Neutral,seems like the chargers went faster
757,Neutral,kaboon
758,Neutral,this the guy that poured molten aluminum on cockroaches
759,Positive,must be rich af tbh not cuz bought all those chargers cuz pay all those electric
760,Positive,lol chargers and only faster than charger most likely had nothing to do with the chargers but rather the different background apps thats running
761,Neutral,stopwatch should have helped
762,Negative,obs all chargers pooped and you view this video because all chargers is fake one is real
763,Neutral,instant charge his phone explodes
764,Positive,cables but with fast charger
765,Neutral,try it with of the macbook chargers
766,Negative,how to blow up phone and burn down an home
767,Neutral,think theres max power level after which any extta power is ignored
768,Positive,the hundreds chargers will increase the voltage value but you should understand that phone charging circuit has in built voltage limiter to prevent sudden fluctuations from charger which make both the phones equal the first phone has good battery so in changed quick try switching both the mobiles and try
769,Neutral,kaboom
770,Neutral,need this now please
771,Positive,the real question is why does he have chargers
772,Neutral,now got to know that why iphone stopped giving chargers in the box
773,Positive,you didnt read science in school guess and fool people will think it true
774,Neutral,this guy probably sold his sold to the devil to pay for that massive bill
775,Neutral,me saw this video and thinks of trying this experiment my iphone please
776,Neutral,nobody youtube lets recommend this video to everyone
777,Positive,each charger is probably giving half watt or even less electricity doesnt work like you think when you use watt power supply in your computer youre not pulling watts youre pulling as much as the components need same with the phone if it only uses watts itll pull watts no matter how many chargers you connect
778,Neutral,then watching grass grow now watching phones die in order to recharge them again one hundredfold then racing rocks now racing phones
779,Positive,the amount of patience this whole video
780,Neutral,minute of silence for the people who didnt got this video in their recommendation
781,Positive,fun fact he just passed one charger through and hot glued the rest inside that deodorant container
782,Neutral,anyone else notice the time he finished at am
783,Neutral,talking quietly so his mom doesnt hear what hes trying
784,Neutral,we should help hes electric bills is gonna be hit
785,Neutral,he talks like his mom is in the next room sleeping
786,Neutral,saw this on meme page
787,Negative,iphone has inbuilt software to stop the battery charging too fast to avoid unnecessary battery wear so the difference will always be minimal
788,Neutral,no one guy in math problems
789,Negative,the phones have limited charge amp drawi think you would have the same result if you attached two of the chargers together believe people would actually think this would charge phone instantly as an electrical engineer this made me lose faith in humanity
790,Positive,you just destroyed apples whole intention to the
791,Neutral,this dude went to an apple store pointed at charger and said take your entire
792,Positive,interesting video but bit extreme the voltage and amperage would fluctuate based on how you connected everything in series or parallel electrical fashion but interesting
793,Positive,ok but where did he get those chargers
794,Neutral,guys pls dont try this at home
795,Neutral,pov below the desk at your aunts office
796,Neutral,are we just going to ignore the speed stick
797,Neutral,please gimme charger
798,Neutral,anyone else noticed that doing this at
799,Positive,imagine his electricity bill lol
800,Neutral,kaboom
801,Neutral,imagine his power bill
802,Positive,youre not using chargers because none of them will provide the max power as the whole system is probably limited to household
803,Neutral,hope we could see his electrical bill
804,Neutral,bruh this electric bill will be critical man
805,Neutral,当たり前で草
806,Neutral,kaboom yes ricko kaboom
807,Negative,all these apple chargers combined cost as much as my fucking house
808,Neutral,boom yes rico boom
809,Neutral,everybody gangsta till the iphone goes supernova
810,Neutral,perhaps of the iphone leads were not
811,Positive,its looks like quantium computer oh this may eats lots of money but that battery why so strong will explode battery phone had voltage limiter
812,Neutral,the is misleading actually instant explosion
813,Positive,friend hey low do you have charger him sure pulls out this monstrosity
814,Positive,when you watch someone charging phone for minutes instead of charging your own wow thanks for the likes lol never got so many before
815,Negative,there are so many things dont see people trying if it werent for youtube except mad scientists
816,Positive,even know you could buy that many power sockets together
817,Negative,im both surprised and disappointed that the phone with cables didnt blew up
818,Neutral,imagine going to ur friends house and asking to use there charger and they whip out chargers and plug in to ur phone
819,Neutral,electroboom will rectify this
820,Neutral,two iphones six asses
821,Neutral,pov you came here from meme
822,Neutral,nobody electric bill
823,Negative,fake because when the charge was going fast it was in time lapse
824,Neutral,your house on fire you homeless hotel travago
825,Positive,lmao imagine the eletrical bill
826,Neutral,why tf did he do it at am
827,Positive,love how this popped up on recommended
828,Neutral,you should this but with android phone and see what happens
829,Negative,wish if he had studied common physics in high school all wires attached will comes out to be same voltage and this poor guy thought chargers will add up the voltage
830,Neutral,the phones are drawing current from the chargers chargers do not push current to the phones it will draw only what it needs
831,Positive,wants the phone battery to die and wish it can charge faster
832,Positive,the battery wont take long lol it will die hella soon
833,Positive,guys what you really want to use is ａｐｐｒｉｖｅｒ its the only working for among us mod
834,Neutral,as techy that is the dumbest cringiest funniest thumbnail have ever seen
835,Neutral,no wonder were all the chargers went bruh moment
836,Positive,chargers tho still very close
837,Neutral,the reason why apple provide charging blocks anymore this guy bought em all
838,Negative,for those who doesnt waste their time short answer is no hit the like if help others manage their time
839,Neutral,kaboom
840,Positive,this guys electric bill is probably more than his was worth
841,Neutral,you want to
842,Neutral,thought battery was gonna go boom
843,Positive,what kind of powerstrips are those
844,Positive,haha
845,Neutral,um kaboom
846,Neutral,thought it was gonna blow
847,Negative,do chargers in single iphone
848,Positive,some people think that you are bad but think you are great just ignore those people
849,Neutral,me watching this from an iphone
850,Negative,your chargers iphone was in dark mode while the normal was in normal mode the dark mode on iphone saves about compared to the normal charger so think there is no difference in charging speed hey could definitely be wrong tho
851,Negative,think thats fake since chargers should theoretically charge at that is not healthy for your phone and would probably instantly destroy it
852,Neutral,paaa aii disgrama
853,Neutral,no ones gonna talk about he filmed this
854,Neutral,unlimited power
855,Negative,nah its fake all the chargers would break minutes later
856,Neutral,try this in series connection
857,Neutral,imagine all all of them in series volts volts
858,Positive,try it with fast charge compatible phone
859,Neutral,cara cepat jumpa tuhan gais
860,Neutral,chargers and blocks cost him
861,Positive,ok so where can get this charger thing
862,Neutral,yomwhat the funk
863,Neutral,learn some basic electricity
864,Neutral,call him lighting guy
865,Neutral,kaboom
866,Neutral,ah ike ike
867,Neutral,kaboom
868,Neutral,kaboom
869,Neutral,kaboom
870,Positive,does someone have count of how many times he says guys
871,Negative,not worth it
872,Neutral,kaboom
873,Neutral,kaboom
874,Neutral,he doing the experiment me electricity
875,Neutral,kaboom
876,Neutral,dont know its not massive keyboard but chargers
877,Neutral,kaboom
878,Neutral,mom do you have an extra charger me no
879,Negative,why did he do this at the dead of the night
880,Neutral,who also cames form the meme
881,Neutral,kaboom
882,Positive,so beautiful
883,Neutral,ghaiabb
884,Neutral,no one your wallet gone
885,Neutral,kaboom
886,Neutral,kaboom
887,Positive,guy plugs charger into phone this feel right what is this
888,Neutral,kaboom
889,Neutral,kaboom
890,Neutral,alright
891,Neutral,what about the health of the battery still bout the same
892,Positive,everyone so how many chargers do you have techrax yes wow didnt expect that many likes thank you guys you are the best
893,Neutral,kaboom
894,Positive,iphone chargers equals like samsung fast chargers
895,Neutral,was thinking it was about to explode
896,Negative,am the only one whos afraid that it might explode
897,Neutral,later total usa power consumption the entire population this guy
898,Neutral,can you start selling these
899,Neutral,have hundred have three ipads they all each came with charger now we have like wth how kep these dought bought it with money and then if ur like us will lose it in day
900,Negative,wtf how you doing this bro
901,Neutral,the ultimate plug
902,Neutral,everybody gangsta until the head of the charger is deodorant stick
903,Negative,power bill be like bro wtf
904,Neutral,kaboom
905,Neutral,kaboom
906,Negative,im not even that good with electrical shit but do know for fact that it virtually would not matter if you had over trillion volts these phones have voltage limiters to protect from stupid shit like this it doesnt make difference
907,Positive,the battery will charge as high as its control chip allows it that is from degraded battery probably
908,Neutral,so he changed this iphone at pm or am to pm or am
909,Negative,the secret behind the anker nano is revealed
910,Positive,doesnt make any big difference youre just manipulating the current wattage on the chargers but the power outlet output voltage still remains the same for one household want fast charging increase the voltage use generator or capacitor battery charging
911,Positive,phone companies made the fastest and best charger yet techrax am joke to you
912,Positive,simple answer using transistors the phone only draws the current it needs no matter how many parallel connected chargers sources based on programmed charging logic ie mah charging rate check feedback battery cannot exceed etc that programsystem app controls the transistors to maintain predetermined maximum ma at voltage level off is or so full is the charger for example only gives but perhaps the charges gives at peak if the phone was jailbroke or the transistors failed full on then the battery would short and if protection on battery failed li ion battery will have safeguards in place to prevent short circuitbut suppose he bypasses that pin on batteryor solders somethingthen fire is set off from overcurrent or overvoltage this is what we were all hoping for
913,Positive,wanted this thing fly
914,Negative,parallel connection doesnt increase voltage but the currentthis iphoneany load takes current only what is needed eventhough it can supply from current the phone doesnt takes it cos it doesnt need that much basically it is pointless connecting all these together
915,Neutral,that is like billion dollars in hardware
916,Neutral,charger charging rate chargers charging rate
917,Positive,get ready to see your electricity bill
918,Negative,not engineerelectrician so tell me if am wrong but would it the charger one only be speed up by because the extra sources of electricity and not extra sources of electricity making guess at
919,Neutral,that heated up
920,Neutral,is it damaging the battery
921,Neutral,tomorrow we transferred all of the energy into charger and plugged it into an iphone
922,Neutral,oh so you bought charger count all of them
923,Negative,waste of
924,Neutral,dude what the hell are you doing
925,Positive,people with much time on their hands lol
926,Neutral,kaboom
927,Positive,iphones have excellent charge gauging as in they charge slower as they get higher its not your imagination from its extremely fast from it slows down bit then is the slowest with specifically being extremely slow dont worry its not done to just piss you off its done so the device doesnt damage its battery by letting in too much charge at once most likely why its extremely rare to hear of an iphone just exploding yeah you cant make the charge last week like some samsung devices but its extremely stable they went with better safe than sorry which mostly likely aided iphones into becoming as popular as they are even as now they arent really getting much better but mainly experimenting with different designs and tossing in piece of candy to bait
928,Neutral,watching this with my iphone battery at
929,Negative,it took the charger iphone minutes to my samsung charger can do that in minutes take that apple shit
930,Neutral,came from the kaboom meme
931,Neutral,is it possible to learn such power
932,Negative,my prediction before read any comments or watch the video is basically the output and input have to be the same apple simply develop for something so emasculate to be done all at once think either the phone will be damaged internally and possibly externally or nothing will happen and charge at the same rate also watched the ten charger video mentioned few seconds before paused
933,Neutral,alternate title how to make your electricity bill more expensive
934,Neutral,this is why apple sell charger bricks anymore
935,Negative,anyone who knows the basics of electricity understands how stupid this is
936,Positive,electricity bill is higher then travis scott
937,Neutral,girl why doesnt he understand my sign her sign
938,Neutral,if this guy lived in my area we wouldve had blackout
939,Neutral,kaboom
940,Neutral,legend still has it hes still paying his electricity bill
941,Positive,apple how many chargers you want techrax yes
942,Neutral,imagine getting chargers just for doubled charging speed
943,Positive,fun fact the costs of the chargers is the half of the price of the phone
944,Neutral,did you burn your house blew up my iphone
945,Neutral,apple know users are accumulating power techrax
946,Neutral,the electricity bill has left the chat
947,Neutral,kaboom
948,Negative,his mom asks why is the electric bill so expensive him idk mom
949,Neutral,the company that gets paid for his electric bills stonks
950,Neutral,thats not the way electricity works sir
951,Neutral,his electric bill what will happen
952,Neutral,instant charging no instant regret
953,Neutral,did anyone notice the time that he was doing this
954,Neutral,his electrical bills must be off the charts
955,Neutral,the nightmare if it was tangled wires
956,Positive,your welcome
957,Positive,kudos too guurusweb on the best
958,Neutral,hmmi wonder where my charger is
959,Neutral,friend hey can borrow your charger
960,Positive,was expecting more honesty
961,Positive,his light bill said
962,Neutral,try magsafe next time
963,Neutral,kaboom
964,Neutral,kaboom
965,Positive,imagine how much power using
966,Positive,you just made better product than apple it charges so much faster you should sell these like why apple make something like this oh right because people the work for apple are dumb lol
967,Negative,well only use instead of cause its not worth it
968,Neutral,me over here needing charger
969,Neutral,me trys this with my iphone

978,Neutral,so this is where all my mf chargers went
979,Neutral,what if you charge phone with chargers the answer instant death
980,Neutral,before watching this will catch on fire we didnt start the fire
981,Positive,my oneplus charged faster with just one charger lol
982,Positive,maybe two minutes it actually took it less than minute but okay
983,Neutral,techraxs electricity bills after making the video stonks
984,Negative,coz they all are in parallel combination due to which voltage remains the same duh
985,Positive,damn lucky watched otherwise bought one of these at the corner store
986,Neutral,my eye iphone not explode my
987,Positive,it is literally freaking almost instant this is pretty cool but imagine the cost of all the chargers

990,Negative,was waiting for an explosion disappointed in science
991,Positive,electric bill price the whole us national debt
992,Negative,imagine trying to plug this in behind the bed
993,Positive,even had to buy new charger coz the old charger got sold along with my iphone and this guy has hundred of them wow
994,Negative,tbh my phone charges in fully in less than an hour and last for around hours with multiple apps opened
995,Neutral,almost the sameafter all those chargers in conclusion apple chargers suck
996,Neutral,so iphone chargers are equal to android speed charger
997,Neutral,me with my oneplus you guys have to wait
998,Neutral,why does my android charger relate to the thicc one
999,Neutral,that wraps it ya say
1000,Positive,lucky can charge fast every time lol
1001,Negative,expected it to explode or be at in less than sec
1002,Neutral,can please use this to charge my ipad mini
1003,Positive,but like it be faster than that lol like literally one charger is only slower by like percent vs yup
1004,Neutral,can have iphone for my online class
1005,Negative,with chargers to charge iphone to percents are still long with small battery capacity my xiaomi with charge from to in only one hour
1006,Positive,dude you wasted chargers wonder if you give them to new ipone buyers make them save money lol
1007,Positive,think the battery is limited to max of charging you could use usb electrical meter to see how much goes trough it
1008,Positive,the phone doesnt support fast charging so its like doesnt have abnormalities
1009,Positive,was honestly waiting for it to blow off all his finger when he plugged it in lol
1010,Positive,if you want phone up to buy an android one tbh thought it would explode or something but im surprised that this aint clickbait
1011,Negative,fail my huawei charger would have charged my phone times over in that time
1012,Negative,thank fuck you made this was literally about to start stripping my chargers here but you saved me from needing to
1013,Positive,ah yes my favorite past time wasting money
1014,Neutral,all of that for differencewow he must have thought that chargers would give it instantly
1015,Neutral,could somebody please give me directions im stranded on the internet again
1016,Neutral,came here when saw meme of this
1017,Positive,know why but like the fact that theirs one capable messed
1018,Positive,this is only the equivalent of charges because there are only plugs that are being plugged in lol
1019,Neutral,so this is where all iphone chargers went
1020,Neutral,hey come from reddit and you
1021,Neutral,its probably only cable thats plugged in the others are just kept in that box without doing anything
1022,Positive,lol my moto can charge form within hours and only have charger
1023,Neutral,thought that the phone will charge in one second
1024,Neutral,charging will explode in reality nah
1025,Negative,ah yes see you were bored during quarantine
1026,Neutral,bang from the beginning
1027,Neutral,anyone getting electroboom vibes
1028,Neutral,times volts the iphone been fried in heartbeat this video is clickbait
1029,Positive,if you went to high school or college you wouldnt have been doing this because physics would have told you that it wouldnt make much difference
1030,Neutral,you cant put charger in charger suspected that that this charger will burn out or it already burned and become weaker witch slowed the charging process
1031,Neutral,the caps cap girls graduation cap
1032,Neutral,there is simply no point to thisthe voltage will be the same and the amp draw will be the same million chargers it makes no difference
1033,Negative,weird is that my almost broken charger still charges faster than that no joke
1034,Neutral,this guy used all his money and for what
1035,Positive,dont ever do this at home you basically created bottleneck one plug for the volts of hundred chargers which if the iphone would have used the full amount of power which it didnt because it does only support maximum amount of watts you probably would have set the point where the bottleneck is on fire
1036,Neutral,harvard you want admission bro
1037,Positive,you wasted so many cables man
1038,Positive,the background music makes it even better
1039,Negative,it wont work the amount of volts will cancel out some of the charges especially if they are in the same extension chord reason know it didnt work was that if the one charger got the phone to then the other should have been
1040,Negative,this has to be one of the stupid things ive ever seen
1041,Neutral,kaboom
1042,Neutral,kaboom
1043,Neutral,kaboom
1044,Neutral,plot twist theres cable charge but only cable connected to the phone
1045,Neutral,imagine if when he plugged it in the phone just exploded
1046,Neutral,kaboom
1047,Negative,bill yum spaghetti john no not spaghetti bill dies john aw crap
1048,Neutral,same thing can be done with watt charger bro

1057,Negative,holy shit this guy is still alive have not seen him since with og xbox one and iphone destruction
1058,Positive,basically vs not like pour more it takes phone has battery management system that draws powers up to its capabilities and specs
1059,Neutral,if it takes hours to charge one phone at for one of those bricks that means that in one hour the brick one should be of battery
1060,Neutral,it started charging slower later on because the battery probably burned out
1061,Neutral,with charging speed comes the electricity bill
1062,Positive,chargers do nothing support of volt is important
1063,Neutral,can we just take moment to appreciate the fact that this guy stayed up till am just to make vid for us
1064,Neutral,bruh all of them is volts and amp obviously its not gonna do anything dum dum
1065,Negative,know some electricity related stuff the reason your phone did not blow up is you put vols across it not because you just placed them in parallel to not in series with the other connectors boom there you go
1066,Neutral,here cause of the meme
1067,Neutral,charges still way slower than samsung charging
1068,Neutral,try it at think the only guy who try it
1069,Neutral,imagine if after all that it said not
1070,Positive,most cellphones withstand this voltage but very certain your combustion was sound of progress my
1071,Neutral,electric companies after inventing this guy stonks

1094,Neutral,him exists also him lets charge phone with chargers
1095,Neutral,yus rusyana ku iwan nu aya dina

1097,Neutral,typec charger
1098,Neutral,anyone else hear because of the memes
1099,Neutral,to think that samsung with one charger is at in an hour

1106,Neutral,kaboom
1107,Neutral,kaboom
1108,Neutral,kaboom
1109,Neutral,kaboom
1110,Positive,fast charging diy

1123,Negative,im honestly disappointed that there were no electrical fires
1124,Positive,this guy has more outlets then the airports do
1125,Neutral,electric bill to infinity and beyond
1126,Positive,why not just to whatever an iphone takes transformer then solder the lighting cable end to it it would accomplish the same exact thing

1138,Positive,teacher the test will be so easy the test trying to untangle that
1139,Negative,behind the scenes be like gang of firetrucks and firefighters
1140,Positive,how does having voltage sources in parallel change charging speed the chargers are rated for max power but the iphone has voltage regulator to prevent the battery from charging quicker this is why you can hook up chargers and the lithium ion battery doesnt explode and catch fire do have degree in electrical engineering but this right here is covered in highschool physics
1141,Neutral,kaboom
1142,Neutral,kaboom
1143,Neutral,kaboom

1152,Neutral,came for the memes
1153,Neutral,can we just appreciate this guy for staying up all night making this video
1154,Positive,logically that doesnt work the max charging current is determined by the mobile phone power supply unit will almost be able to deliver the max charging current the hundred power supplies could do more but if the mobile phone isnt using it if the charging current wasnt limited the device would be destroyed
1155,Neutral,rip his electricity bills
1156,Neutral,nikola tesla hmm intresting
1157,Neutral,resistor am joke to you
1158,Neutral,how did you not check battery health afterwards

1174,Negative,im just thinking of the thousands of pounds he spent on those apple chargers
1175,Negative,when you connect them all in parallel the voltage stays the same as if you had single one
1176,Positive,saw this on meme in instagram lmao wanted to look at it
1177,Positive,love it when pay the price of charger for faster charge rate
1178,Neutral,the electricity bill just zoooooomed up
1179,Neutral,electricity bills be like fbi open up
1180,Positive,think it has something to do with the charging port clearly more input is being put in but its not shown
1181,Positive,and introducing the new ideodorant charger
1182,Neutral,well it didnt explode check the battery health after the charge to see if it got lower
1183,Positive,wow watching this while my cord is not working
1184,Neutral,why would you do this with the chargers
1185,Neutral,you should have connected it in series

1210,Positive,ok this explain why apple sell the new iphone without the charger
1211,Neutral,think it work because of serial and parallel with the plugs
1212,Positive,where the hell do you buy outlet power strip costco lol edit lol just watched the part where its actually power strips
1213,Positive,lmao why just why limit to how much wattage that iphone will accept no matter how much power you will throw at it probably would have gotten the same result from an ipad charger
1214,Neutral,teeheecharger go zapzap
1215,Neutral,did not increase bij parallel so de resistans is the same and you get the same watts to youre phone
1216,Positive,literally man full chargers oh god
1217,Positive,the current is probably really high from all those
1218,Neutral,rico kaboom skipperyes ricokaboom
1219,Neutral,lets say charger gives you an output of volts dc then that is chargers which gives you volts dc current
1220,Neutral,bro techrax never clickbaits never put techrax and clickbait in the same sentence again even tho just did
1221,Positive,the fact that he did this at am makes it so much better
1222,Negative,honestly expected it to charge faster
1223,Neutral,kaboom yes rico kaboom
1224,Positive,expected it to explode lol
1225,Positive,wonder if the charging cube mitigates any phasing issues if you plugged the chargers into opposing phase outlets with them soldered together pretty curious about it actually you can flip the hot and neutral in the cube just by flipping it upside no prong bigger than the other to key the neutral now really curious
1226,Neutral,thought it would start smoking
1227,Positive,technically as fast
1228,Positive,my phone charger charges almost as fast as the charger iphone
1229,Neutral,kaboom

1238,Negative,repent before its too late
1239,Negative,this dude goin to end the world by making black hole in his room
1240,Neutral,this is because there is amp limiter before the battery to protect against exploding batteries
1241,Neutral,this dude buys chargers apple stonks
1242,Negative,me anxious af to see if the phone blows up
1243,Neutral,iphone chargers my mind theres imposter among us
1244,Positive,connecting them like he did just makes ultra charger have more current capability given that stock charger has at amp of current connecting of them wont make it as the phone decides how much current it takes at all times as well as current controllesrs in chargers
1245,Neutral,at this point you may as well have the phone get struck by lightning
1246,Neutral,apple sell the charger this guy want ur entire stock
1247,Neutral,literally every person within radius km of him hey have you seen my phone charger
